# Amazon SageMaker Pipelines 
- You can automate the entire model build workflow, including data preparation, feature engineering, model training, model tuning, and model validation, and catalog it in the model registry.  
- You can configure pipelines to run automatically at regular intervals or when certain events are triggered, or you can run them manually as needed.  
- SageMaker Pipelines is a native workflow orchestration tool  for building ML pipelines that take advantage of direct Amazon SageMaker  integration.
-   

# SageMaker Workflows
- As you scale your machine learning (ML) operations, you can use Amazon SageMaker fully managed workflow services to implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices for your ML lifecycle.
- For Kubernetes based architectures, you can install SageMaker Operators on your Kubernetes cluster to create SageMaker jobs natively using the Kubernetes API and command-line Kubernetes tools such as kubectl.
- 

##  SageMaker offers the following workflow technologies:
- Amazon SageMaker Model Building Pipelines: Tool for building and managing ML pipelines. 
- Kubernetes Orchestration: SageMaker custom operators for your Kubernetes cluster and components for Kubeflow Pipelines. 
- SageMaker Notebook Jobs: On demand or scheduled non-interactive batch runs of your Jupyter notebook.

### You can also leverage other services that integrate with SageMaker to build your workflow. Options include the following services:
-  Airflow Workflows: SageMaker APIs to export configurations for creating and managing Airflow workflows.
-  AWS Step Functions: Multi-step ML workflows in Python that orchestrate SageMaker infrastructure without having to provision your resources separately.

## Three components improve the operational resilience and reproducibility of your ML workflows: 
 - pipelines
 - model registry, and
 - projects.

# SageMaker projects
- SageMaker projects introduce MLOps templates that automatically provision the underlying resources needed to enable CI/CD capabilities for your ML development lifecycle.
- The following screenshot shows how the three components of SageMaker Pipelines can work together in an example SageMaker project.

- The MLOps templates that are made available through SageMaker projects are provided via an AWS Service Catalog  portfolio that automatically gets imported when a user enables projects on the Studio domain.
- Two repositories are added to AWS CodeCommit :
- The first repository provides scaffolding code to create a multi-step model building pipeline including the following steps:
     - data processing,
     - model training,
     - model evaluation, and
     - conditional model registration based on accuracy.
- As you can see in the pipeline.py file, this pipeline trains a linear regression model using the XGBoost algorithm on the well-known UCI Abalone dataset .
- This repository also includes a build specification file , used by AWS CodePipeline  and AWS CodeBuild  to run the pipeline automatically.
- The second repository contains code and configuration files for model deployment, as well as test scripts required to pass the quality gate.
    - This repo also uses CodePipeline and CodeBuild, which run an AWS CloudFormation  template to create model endpoints for staging and production.

- Two CodePipeline pipelines:
    -   The ModelBuild pipeline automatically triggers and runs the pipeline from end to end whenever a new commit is made to the ModelBuild CodeCommit repository.
    -   The ModelDeploy pipeline automatically triggers whenever a new model version is added to the model registry and the status is marked as Approved. Models that are registered with Pending or Rejected statuses arenâ€™t deployed.
