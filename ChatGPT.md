 your data is in Excel format and you want to query it using Athena, you would typically need to convert the Excel files to a supported format, such as CSV or Apache Parquet, before creating an external table in Athena. You can use tools like Apache Arrow, Pandas, or other ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to perform this conversion.

Here's a brief overview of the supported file formats in Athena:

uerying:
After creating the table, you can run SQL queries on it, and Athena will automatically parse the JSON data using the specified SerDe.
AWS Glue Crawler:
Crawling JSON Data:
AWS Glue Crawler is used to discover and infer the schema of your JSON data. When you run a Glue Crawler on your S3 bucket containing JSON files, it analyzes the data and creates a metadata catalog entry.
Data Catalog:
The inferred schema and metadata are stored in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. The Data Catalog acts as a central repository for metadata about your data sources, making it easier to manage and query the data.
Schema Evolution:
The Glue Crawler also handles schema evolution. If your JSON data evolves over time (new fields are added or existing fields change types), the Glue Crawler detects these changes and updates the metadata catalog accordingly.
Integration with Athena:
Once the Glue Crawler has created the metadata, you can use Athena to query the JSON data based on the inferred schema. The integration with the Glue Data Catalog simplifies the process of discovering and querying your data.
Summary:
Athena allows you to define a schema explicitly in SQL using a JSON SerDe, whereas Glue Crawler automatically infers the schema and manages schema evolution based on the actual JSON data.
Athena is more manual but offers control over the schema definition, while Glue Crawler automates the discovery process.
Both services enable you to query JSON data using SQL-like queries, making it easy to analyze structured data stored in JSON format.
It's worth noting that AWS services and features are subject to updates and improvements. Always refer to the official AWS documentation for the latest information on how Athena and Glue handle JSON files.
