A common best practice for versioning AWS Lambda functions is to use AWS Lambda aliases. Create aliases such as “prod,” “dev,” or “test” and associate each alias with a specific version of your Lambda function. This allows you to update the function without changing the alias, making it easier to switch between versions and deploy updates seamlessly. Additionally, consider using version numbers in your function names or tags for clearer identification.

In your machine learning model ops platform, you can adopt the following versioning strategy to maintain compatibility with older AWS Lambda distributions:

	1.	Lambda Function Names:
	•	Include version numbers or labels in your Lambda function names. For example, use a naming convention like “YourFunction_v1,” “YourFunction_v2,” and so on.
	2.	Lambda Aliases:
	•	Create aliases for different versions, such as “prod_v1,” “prod_v2,” etc. Assign each alias to the corresponding version of your Lambda function.
	3.	API Gateway or Event Source:
	•	If your Lambda functions are triggered by an API Gateway or other event sources, ensure that you maintain backward compatibility in your event payloads.
	4.	Documentation:
	•	Clearly document the changes in each version, including any updates to input/output formats, dependencies, or configurations that might impact users.
	5.	Client Libraries:
	•	If you provide client libraries or SDKs for users to interact with your Lambda functions, version those libraries in alignment with your Lambda function versions. This helps users seamlessly transition between different versions.
	6.	Deprecation Policy:
	•	Implement a deprecation policy to inform users about the lifecycle of each version. Clearly communicate when a version will be deprecated and encourage users to upgrade to newer versions.

By following these practices, you can ensure that your customers can choose and transition between different Lambda function versions based on their compatibility requirements.

While AWS Lambda doesn’t have a versioning system for function code as explicit as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) does for container images, you can implement a similar approach by using Lambda function aliases. Here’s a simplified comparison:

	1.	Lambda Aliases:
	•	Create aliases for different versions of your Lambda function, such as “prod_v1,” “prod_v2,” etc.
	•	Each alias can be associated with a specific version of your Lambda function code.
	•	Users can invoke a specific alias to use a particular version of your function.
	2.	Deployment and Updating:
	•	When deploying new versions, update the Lambda function code and then point the alias to the new version.
	•	Users can choose which alias to invoke, effectively selecting the version of the function they want to use.
	3.	Permissions and IAM:
	•	Ensure that users have the necessary IAM permissions to invoke the specific aliases they want to use.
	4.	Documentation:
	•	Clearly document the available aliases, their corresponding versions, and any changes introduced in each version.

While this doesn’t mirror the container image versioning in ECR precisely, it provides a way for users to choose which version of your Lambda function they want to invoke by selecting the appropriate alias.

Remember that Lambda is designed to abstract away the infrastructure details, so the versioning mechanism is more lightweight compared to container images. Users typically interact with your Lambda function through its ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and aliases, making it simpler for them to choose a version based on the provided aliases.
