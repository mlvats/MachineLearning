aws lambda publish-version --function-name YourFunctionName

AWS CLI Commands:
Publishing a Version:
bash


Copy code
aws lambda publish-version --function-name YourFunctionName
Invoking a Specific Version:
bash
Copy code
aws lambda invoke --function-name YourFunctionName:1 output.txt
Invoking the Latest Version:
bash
Copy code
aws lambda invoke --function-name YourFunctionName:latest output.txt


# Create version 2
aws lambda publish-version --function-name MyLambdaFunction

# Invoke version 2
aws lambda invoke --function-name MyLambdaFunction:2 output.txt


# Alias

aws lambda create-alias --function-name YourFunctionName --function-version 2 --name YourAlias

aws lambda update-alias --function-name YourFunctionName --function-version 3 --name YourAlias

aws lambda delete-alias --function-name YourFunctionName --name YourAlias

aws lambda list-aliases --function-name YourFunctionName

Example Usage:
Let's say you have a Lambda function named "MyLambdaFunction," and you want to create an alias "prod" pointing to version 2:

aws lambda create-alias --function-name MyLambdaFunction --function-version 2 --name prod

Now, you can invoke your Lambda function using the "prod" alias:
aws lambda invoke --function-name MyLambdaFunction:prod --payload '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}' output.txt


Alias Instead of Version:
While versions are a way to reference specific snapshots, using aliases is often recommended for managing invocations in a more flexible manner. Aliases can be updated to point to different versions, allowing you to promote changes through different environments without modifying the invoking code.

Keep in mind that using aliases for version management is often more flexible and recommended in real-world scenarios.
